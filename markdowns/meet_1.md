# Data Science Meet #1
_24 March 2017_

> Data Scientist (n.): A person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. 
>-- Some good guy on Google
##### Data Science

  - Not a new thing. Has always been there. 
  - Rebranded with the inclusion of developing technologies in various field.
  - Can be safely viewed as a mix of mathematics, stats, information science, computer science (machine learning, databases, visualisation). Oh well.. 
 
##### Skills needed!
- Programming! _Python, R_
- Maths, stats.
- Ability to see through data and things that muggles can't see. 
- Creative
- A heart. _solid and strong_  

##### Data 
- Raw information? Of course. 
- There's a lot more than a 'raw information'. Data can be seen as an abstraction of the real world. 
- Like a photo, there's a lot more to it than just a 'photo'. It depends on the reason you're viewing it, who's viewing it etc. 
- To put it into a data science perspective, when you have a hold of a dataset, it's up to you to decide on how you view the data, what insights do you wish to uncover from them, etc...

##### Data do not come in a box wrapped with a red ribbon. 
- Proper data cleaning is needed. Why? Missing values, unimportant features, inaccurate data, etc...
- Tools to check out: Python pandas, numpy, scipy; R

##### You are not done yet (unfortunately).

- Then comes feature analysis, feature selection, feature engineering, feature ranking.
- You may want to find for data correlations here in this phase, and a bunch of other stuffs. Complicated stuffs..
- Among the algos mentioned by Hazim, Information Gain etc. 
- Other approaches? Find them. Discuss.
- Tools to check out: WEKA, Rapid Miner etc

##### Add some colours
- Transform your data into visualisations. 
- There are a lot of things that the eyes can't see. Especially when they're buried in a table with 100,000 lines and 30 columns. 
- Tools to check out: Matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau, Echarts.js etc

##### .. almost done but not quite. 

- Now that you have everything sorted out, it's time to generate something meaningful out of it. 
- Prediction? Analysis? Recommendation? Just to name a few.
- Involves machine learning. Maths.. Maths.. Maths.. 
- Tools to check out: Turi, Python Scikit-Learn, R, WEKA, Rapid Miner

##### You're done
- You have your predictions ready.
- Fingers crossed that it worked. The accuracy is good. The generalization error is good. Everything is good. 
- Present your solution and win. 

##### You can however..
skip through all the hassle

> ~~Maths.. Maths.. Maths..~~
- **Use Rapid Miner and brag.** 
- _Refer Hazim for details on Rapid Miner._
